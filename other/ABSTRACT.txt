This project aims to develop a comprehensive Car Park Management System that includes a mobile app for clients 
and a web app for administrators. The system's primary objective is to automate the parking lot management 
process, resulting in a more efficient and convenient parking experience for clients and increased revenue 
for car park operators.

The proposed mobile app will enable clients to reserve parking spaces, make payments, and receive real-time 
notifications about parking availability, making the entire parking process more streamlined and user-friendly. 
The web app for administrators will allow them to monitor parking lot occupancy, billing, and generate reports, 
reducing the administrative workload and improving management efficiency.

The project's success will be evaluated based on its ability to provide a more efficient and convenient parking 
experience for clients, increase revenue for car park operators, and reduce the administrative workload associated 
with managing parking lots.

Overall, the proposed Car Park Management System has the potential to transform the parking industry, providing 
a user-friendly and efficient approach to managing and monitoring parking lots.
