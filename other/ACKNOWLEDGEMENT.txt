I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of my 
interim presentation report on the Car Park Management System for my final year project.

Firstly, I extend my sincere thanks to my project guide/professor for providing me with invaluable guidance, 
support, and encouragement throughout the project. I am grateful for your patience, guidance, and insightful 
feedback, which have enabled me to move forward with my work.

I would also like to thank my classmates and friends who have provided me with their valuable suggestions and 
feedback, which helped me to refine my project further. Their encouragement and support have been a great 
motivation throughout my project.

Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to my family for their constant support and encouragement 
throughout my academic journey. Their love, encouragement, and unwavering support have been a driving force behind 
my success.

Thank you all once again for your support and contribution to my project.
